                <h2>My Beginnings</h2>
                  <p>I was born in Fairbury, Nebraska to 2 hippies that were trying to
               be self substaining farmers. I developed a special bond with
               horses and up through my teenage years, I rode and trained horses in the boondocks of Nebraska.</p>

               <p>I graduated from Norris High School with 126 kids in my class. In 2004, it was wiped out by a tornado and had to be rebuilt.</p>
